# counts number of "mapped read pairs" = "mapped fragments"
# this is NOT the same thing as number of "mapped paired reads" = "mapped reads"
# uses the bowtie2 log file where "mapped read pairs" = "were paired" - "pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly"
# i.e. the number of read pairs subtracted by the number of read pairs that did NOT map (concordantly or discordantly)
# usage:
# python count-mapped-fragments.py
# will print to screen the name of every file ending in ".log" and the number calculated from the equation described above
