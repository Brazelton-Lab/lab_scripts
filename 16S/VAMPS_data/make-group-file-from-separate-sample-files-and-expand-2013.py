"""
make group file where the sample name is the fasta filename, not in the fasta header
in other words, takes a folder full of .fasta files and makes one group file
also expands the file names as in fasta-expander-vamps-2013.py
specify the extension in the command
script must be run from same folder as the files, or else specify the path in the script below

usage example 1:
python make-group-file-from-separate-sample-files.py .fa

usage example 2:
python make-group-file-from-separate-sample-files.py .unique
