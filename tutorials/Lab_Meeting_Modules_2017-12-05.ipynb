    "This tutorial will cover how to use the `module` program on the Brazelton Lab Cluster. To follow along, you must login to said cluster using the crednetials provided to you by a Systems Administrator. Additionally, this tutorial will briefly cover BASH variables and environmental variables (EV) as understanding them is necessary for understanding `modules`.\n",

    "\n",
    "BASH stands for Bourne Again SHell and is the most common terminal interface in \\*nix systems. BASH is both a shell and a scripting language, meaning you can program in the tutorial. The following example makes three empty files using `touch`, uses a `for loop` to print files names starting with \"test\", and then deletes them with `rm`. *Note: a `for loop` is a programming construct. Thus, thus the following example uses code in the terminal.*"
